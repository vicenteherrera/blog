On the 9th of December 2021, a critical update was published for the popular open source Log4j&nbsp;2 library. The next day it was classified as **CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;44228**.<!--more--> Some people started calling it “**log4shell**”, as it allowed very easily to do a remote code execution attack. Four days later it was patched again, for a new vulnerability that allowed a denial of service attack, tagged as **CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;45046**. 

The implications are so huge that I had to break this article into two parts. In this first one, I’ll center on my personal investigation of the history of the library, its vulnerabilities, software vendor response, and who are its maintainers (support them!). 

In the second part, I’ll explain in my own words how the vulnerability works, what detections and remediations work, and which ones are only partial or directly are wrong information and won’t work at all.

## What is Log4j 2?

[Apache Log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x){:target="_blank"} is a very popular open source Java library used to manage logging messages.

It is included in several frameworks like [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/logging.html){:target="_blank"}, [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/2021/12/10/log4j-cve.html){:target="_blank"}, [Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/guide/6_6/configuring-logging.html){:target="_blank"}, [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.2/configuration.html#configuring-logging){:target="_blank"}, [Apache Struts 2](https://struts.apache.org/announce-2021#a20211212-2){:target="_blank"}, and [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/logging.html){:target="_blank"} (although that doesn’t mean directly that they are vulnerable, read more about this in part II).


The extent of use of this library was so huge that a whole snowball of updates and patches took over the Internet.

## History

A 0-day refers to a vulnerability that was not publicly known before. It may be zero for you and me, but being wildly exploited in secret. To put things in context, let’s start this story at the beginning.


### 2009 (11 years earlier)

Dissatisfied by Log4j version 1 and other equivalent libraries, **Ralph Goers** starts working on Log4j version 2 for the first time among the Apache foundation. [You can read details about this in his blog post “Why was Log4j&nbsp;2 created?”](https://www.ralphgoers.com/post/why-was-log4j-2-created){:target="_blank"}. It will take years for the developers to consider releasing a stable version.


### 2013 (8 years earlier)

**September 14**: [Log4J 2.0-beta9 is released](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.0-beta9){:target="_blank"}, the first version that years later will be reported as vulnerable.


### 2014 (7 years earlier)

**July 12**: [Log4j 2.0 is published](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.0){:target="_blank"}, first version not alpha o beta, 5 years after the project started.


### 2015 (6 years earlier)

**October 21:** A related [CVE-2015-4902](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-4902){:target="_blank"} gets published with the description


> “Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u101, 7u85, and 8u60 allows remote attackers to affect integrity via unknown vectors related to Deployment.”
{:.quote}

Many “unspecified” and “unknowns” for a description. [It could be argued that not specifying the description of the vulnerability shouldn’t be allowed for a complete CVE report](https://twitter.com/adulau/status/1469959657049538561?s=20){:target="_blank"}.


![Chart of word occurence in CVE, unspecified appears 15000 times](/blog/images/cve_unspecified.png "Chart of word occurence in CVE, unspecified appears 15000 times")
_Source: [Alexandre Dulaunoy](https://twitter.com/adulau/status/1469959657049538561?s=20){:target="_blank"} [2013 analysis of CVEs](http://www.foo.be/cve/){:target="_blank"} ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search){:target="_blank"})_

The same day, you can read on [ITPro website news](https://www.itpro.com/security/25469/oracle-fixes-vulnerability-used-in-nato-and-white-house-hacks){:target="_blank"} (this is a summary):

> Oracle has patched up a flaw in Java that allowed hackers to breach targets such as **NATO** and the **White House** in an operation known as **Pawn Storm**. The vulnerability was used in attacks on web assets belonging the military organisation as well as a number of prominent companies, according to Trend Micro threat analyst Jack Tang.
\
> The flaw in question (CVE-2015-4902) managed to evade Java's Click-to-Play protection, which requires the user to click the space where the Java app would normally be displayed before it is executed. In effect, it asks the user if they are really sure they want to run any Java code.
\
> Bypassing click-to-play protection allows for malicious Java code to run without any alert windows being shown. To mount an attack, a hacker adds the HTML code to a malicious web site and then creates a RMI registry server which has a public IP address as well as creating another web server to hold the malicious Java code, which also has a public IP address.

### 2016 (5 years earlier)

At [BlackHat USA 2016, a presentation](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Munoz-A-Journey-From-JNDI-LDAP-Manipulation-To-RCE.pdf){:target="_blank"} by Alvaro Muñoz and Oleksandr Mirosh from HP Enterprise Fortinet, shows how a combination of JDNI injection and LDAP entry poisoning could be used to make remote code execution possible, as was described in CVE-2015-4902 the previous year. These are the same kind of steps involved in exploiting the later discovered Log4j&nbsp;2 vulnerability.

</div>

### 2017 (4 years earlier)

**March 7**: A new vulnerability is discovered, unrelated to Log4j, but on the also very popular open source framework, Apache Struts. A situation where many companies use it and have to patch it develops, similar to what has happened with Log4j&nbsp;2.

**March 10**: Reports of hacking groups start looking for systems that are not updated with a fix.

**May 12**: [Equifax is hit very hard by a data breach, the biggest known to that date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach#Data_breach){:target="_blank"} because of a vulnerable Apache Struts. Some companies learn they can’t leave security and updating as a second thought. Others… don’t learn it.

### 2021

**November 24**: [Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba privately reports the Log4j&nbsp;2 vulnerability](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/how-apache-raced-to-fix-a-potentially-disastrous-software-flaw){:target="_blank"} to the Apache team.

**November 30**: A pull request by Ralph Goers (original Log4j&nbsp;2 creator) is opened in the [Log4j GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608){:target="_blank"} titled “Restrict LDAP access via JNDI” to fix the issue.

**December 1st**: Log4j&nbsp;2 exploit evidence as early as this day will later be [found and tweeted about by Matthew Prince](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1469800951351427073){:target="_blank"}, CEO of CloudFlare. But it won’t be mass exploited until after the public disclosure.

**December 5th**: The [pull request is merged](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608){:target="_blank"} five days after Ralph Goers created it. Take into consideration that he states in his bio that “I work on Log4j and other open source projects in my spare time”.

**December 6th**: [A new version of Log4j&nbsp;2 is released, 2.15.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.15.0){:target="_blank"}, which includes many improvements. This update fixes the remote code execution, but 7 days later will be proven vulnerable to a possible denial of service attack. [Among the changes](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/#Mitigation){:target="_blank"}, there is a mention to:

> In version 2.12.2 Log4j&nbsp;2 disables access to JNDI by default. Usage of JNDI in configuration now need to be enabled explicitly. Calls to the JndiLookup will now return a constant string. Also, Log4j&nbsp;2 now limits the protocols by default to only java. The message lookups feature has been completely removed.
{:.quote}

**December 8th**: Alibaba’s Chen reports to the Log4j&nbsp;2 team again that someone had just [revealed the details of the vulnerability on a Chinese blogging platform](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/how-apache-raced-to-fix-a-potentially-disastrous-software-flaw){:target="_blank"}. 

My opinion is that maybe it was somebody that saw the pull request. With all the caution Chen demonstrated I doubt it had something to do with him or people near him.

**December 9th**: User [tangxiaofeng7](https://www.cnblogs.com/suyu7){:target="_blank"} publishes in GitHub [a proof of concept for exploiting the vulnerability](https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/CVE-2021-44228-Apache-Log4j-Rce/commit/6c209161477d048d32f3eb3e7b4f83abc9cf94a5){:target="_blank"} (this and other security-related repositories that I personally was investigating on his account have been deleted or made private). The vulnerability is [being tweeted about](https://twitter.com/P0rZ9/status/1468949890571337731){:target="_blank"} (the tweet has been deleted before I could see it). As related information is only in Chinese, my lack of knowledge of that language, and limitations using Google Translate prevents me to investigate further.

**December 10th**: The vulnerability in Log4j&nbsp;2 for remote code execution is **published** as [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;44228](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228){:target="_blank"}, with a **score of 10.0** (the maximum value).

The **same day** [reports and news](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/10/severe-flaw-in-java-library-impacts-icloud-amazon-steam-and-more){:target="_blank"} start appearing continuously demonstrating [very popular affected software](https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1469255402290401285?s=20){:target="_blank"}. GrayNoise network security provider tweets about [the number of hosts exploiting the vulnerability increasing from 100 to 150 in several hours](https://twitter.com/GreyNoiseIO/status/1469376214079053833){:target="_blank"}. [Fastly reports](https://www.fastly.com/blog/digging-deeper-into-log4shell-0day-rce-exploit-found-in-log4j#what-we-ve-seen){:target="_blank"} that in 24 hours of the report, the occurrences when scanning for the “jndi:” string that is employed in the exploit has spiked and that attackers are invested in researching different ways of exploiting the vulnerability, which is not true for all 0-day vulnerabilities that become public.

![Explopits attempts for Log4j&nbsp;2 vulnerability in first 24 hours of disclouse](/blog/images/log4j_spike.png "Explopit attempts for Log4j&nbsp;2 vulnerability in first 24 hours of disclouse"){:.shadow}

I'm certain this will create a big campaign for hacker groups, not only trying to exploit this vulnerability, but seeking similar 0-days "gems" that may have been also missing in similar circumstances. First on Log4j (but I assume this library is going to get a lot of scrutinity), then for other popular similar libraries.

**December 13th**: [A new version released of Log4j&nbsp;2, v2.16.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0){:target="_blank"} is released, which fixes some special cases that could result in a denial of service attack. It disables JNDI by default (fixing [LOG4J2-3208](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3208){:target="_blank"}) and completely removes support for Message Lookups (fixing [LOG4J2-3211](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3211)){:target="_blank"}. [As explained on their website](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/#Mitigation){:target="_blank"}:


> In version 2.16.0 Log4j disables access to JNDI by default. JNDI lookups in configuration now need to be enabled explicitly. Also, Log4j now limits the protocols by default to only java, ldap, and ldaps and limits the ldap protocols to only accessing Java primitive objects. Hosts other than the local host need to be explicitly allowed. The message lookups feature has been completely removed.

**December 14th**: The related vulnerability [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;45046](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-45046){:target="_blank"} is reported for the improved fix, in this case with a score value of just **3.2**.

## Who has been affected?

!["Everyone" ](/blog/images/everyone.gif "Everyone")

Not only the software you are developing may use one of those frameworks or the Log4j&nbsp;2 library directly, but also many other software products you use may do so.

As the main company behind Java, many [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html){:target="_blank"} products are affected (you need to log into your Oracle account to see the full list).

5 days after publishing the first vulnerability, some of the companies/products reported as affected are [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://github.blog/2021-12-13-githubs-response-to-log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/){:target="_blank"}, [cPanel](https://www.eukhost.com/blog/webhosting/cpanel-log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/){:target="_blank"}, [SolarWinds SAM and DPA](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Server-Application-Monitor-SAM-and-the-Apache-Log4j-Vulnerability-CVE-2021-44228?language=en_US){:target="_blank"}, [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/bulletins/splunk-security-advisory-for-apache-log4j-cve-2021-44228.html){:target="_blank"}, [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/support/releases/server/2021.2.5){:target="_blank"}, several [Cisco products](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd){:target="_blank"}, [ArcGIS Enterprise](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-enterprise/administration/arcgis-software-and-cve-2021-44228-aka-log4shell-aka-logjam/){:target="_blank"}, [F-Secure products](https://status.f-secure.com/incidents/sk8vmr0h34pd), [GoAnywhere](https://www.goanywhere.com/cve-2021-44228-goanywhere-mitigation-steps){:target="_blank"}, [GrayLog](https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-update-for-log4j){:target="_blank"}, [Jitsi](https://github.com/jitsi/security-advisories/blob/4e1ab58585a8a0593efccce77d5d0e22c5338605/advisories/JSA-2021-0004.md){:target="_blank"}, [Liferay](https://liferay.dev/blogs/-/blogs/log4j2-zero-day-vulnerability), [New Relic Java agent](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/log4j-zero-day-vulnerability-and-the-new-relic-java-agent/170322){:target="_blank"}, [Okta Radius and MFA agents](https://sec.okta.com/articles/2021/12/log4shell){:target="_blank"}, [Siemens](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-661247.pdf){:target="_blank"}, some [Sophos](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/security-advisories/sophos-sa-20211210-log4j-rce){:target="_blank"} services, [Sumo Logic](https://help.sumologic.com/Release-Notes/Collector-Release-Notes#december-11-2021-19-361-12){:target="_blank"}, [Suse OpenStack Cloud](https://www.suse.com/c/suse-statement-on-log4j-log4shell-cve-2021-44228-vulnerability/){:target="_blank"}, [TP-Link Omanda Controller](https://community.tp-link.com/en/business/forum/topic/514452){:target="_blank"}, some [Trend Micro](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/000289940#Impact) services, [Veritas Netbackup](https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/article.100052058){:target="_blank"}, many [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0028.html){:target="_blank"} products. Some specific versions of [Elasticsearch and Logstash](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476){:target="_blank"} are affected. [Some on-premise products of Atlassian](https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/faq-for-cve-2021-44228-1103069406.html){:target="_blank"} are partially affected (they use their own fork of Log4j). [Minecraft Server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition){:target="_blank"} Java edition is affected, so now is when you know that it is real.

Other products like [GitLab](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/cve-2021-4428/62763){:target="_blank"} or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/an-update-on-the-apache-log4j-vulnerability){:target="_blank"} don’t use Log4j, and [Apache Kafka uses Log4j 1](https://lists.apache.org/thread/lgbtvvmy68p0059yoyn9qxzosdmx4jdv){:target="_blank"}, so they claim they are not affected by this (not true, more on this on part II). [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/){:target="_blank"} isn’t affected, but plugins installed in it may be, like [Jenkins Xray Connector](https://github.com/jenkinsci/xray-connector-plugin/issues/53){:target="_blank"}.

Saas software providers like [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/log4j2-security-advisory){:target="_blank"}, [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2021-006/){:target="_blank"} and [MongoDB Atlas Search](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/log4shell-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-and-mongodb){:target="_blank"} also are known to have been using Log4j, and has been their responsibility to update, patch, or mitigate the problem.

[Azure](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/12/11/microsofts-response-to-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2/){:target="_blank"} announces that it’s not using or directly providing Log4j, but [Kafka Connect for Azure Cosmos DB](https://github.com/microsoft/kafka-connect-cosmosdb/blob/0f5d0c9dbf2812400bb480d1ff0672dfa6bb56f0/CHANGELOG.md){:target="_blank"} provided by Microsoft is affected. [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt/an-update-on-the-apache-log4j-cve-2021-44228-vulnerability/){:target="_blank"} and [Salesforce](https://status.salesforce.com/generalmessages/826){:target="_blank"} seem to be still investigating the impact as December 14th, but at least [IBM Sterling Order Management](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6525544){:target="_blank"} is affected.

Users claim that [Steam](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29499867){:target="_blank"} was vulnerable in its chat service, but I find no evidence, and no official announcement has been made. [Netflix](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ANetflix+CVE-2021-44228&type=commits){:target="_blank"} seems to have also patched the library. Apple and iCloud have been affected and [changing an iPhone name](https://twitter.com/chvancooten/status/1469340927923826691){:target="_blank"} has been reported as triggering the vulnerability.

Insecure versions of Log4j&nbsp;2 were available on [Debian](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44228){:target="_blank"} and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-44228){:target="_blank"}, who have released updates.

[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-44228){:target="_blank"} ships with Elasticsearch that uses a compromised version, but because of the use of the Java Security Manager, access to it is limited so the problem is moderate at most.

Kudos to [SwitHak](https://twitter.com/SwitHak/status/1469467786997121029){:target="_blank"} for compiling an incredible [list of links announcements from software vendors](https://gist.github.com/SwitHak/b66db3a06c2955a9cb71a8718970c592){:target="_blank"}, from which most of this information has been compiled.

Log4j 2 was created by [Ralph Goers](https://www.ralphgoers.com/post/why-was-log4j-2-created){:target="_blank"}. The [most active people committing to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/graphs/contributors){:target="_blank"} now are him, [Gary Gregory](https://github.com/garydgregory){:target="_blank"}, [Remko Popma](https://github.com/remkop){:target="_blank"} and [Matt Sicker](https://github.com/jvz){:target="_blank"}.

Just before the exploit was published, [Ralph had only 7 sponsors](https://twitter.com/MrDanack/status/1469524817946816515){:target="_blank"} on GitHub, on December 15 [he had 78 and going up, but still, none of them are companies](https://github.com/sponsors/rgoers){:target="_blank"}. The rest of the developers with sponsorship enabled had that day a combined amount of 3 sponsors.

In Ralph’s words that you can read on [his GitHub bio](https://github.com/sponsors/rgoers){:target="_blank"}:

> I currently have a full time job as a Software Architect. I work on Log4j and other open source projects in my spare time and so I typically work on those issues that are of most interest to me. **I have always dreamed of working on open source full time and would love your support to enable that to happen**.

The individuals who contribute to Apache projects do it either as part of specific tasks assigned to them by their employer, on their own initiative to benefit their employer, or on their own free time. While some projects at the ASF have employees who are specifically paid to work on the project, **none of the committers to any of the Logging Services projects are directly paid to work on them**.

I think they have done an excellent job reviewing, patching and publishing fast updates to the vulnerabilities. You can sponsor maintainers of Log4j with a one-time donation, or on a recurring monthly basis on their GitHub profile. **If you can get your company to sponsor them, you will contribute to keep open source safer for you, your company, and everybody else**. The maintainers that accept sponsorship are:

* [Ralph Goers](https://github.com/rgoers){:target="_blank"}
* [Gary Gregory](https://github.com/garydgregory){:target="_blank"}
* [Matt Sicker](https://github.com/jvz){:target="_blank"}

## Conclusion

The Log4j 2 vulnerabilities discovered on 10th of December 2021 existed since many years ago, and has caused a huge snowball of insecurities affecting your project, other open and closed source software, as well as cloud services.

The maintainers of that library work on it on their spare time without official support from any company, but have been able to act very fast to publish fixes for the problemas.

Despite this, the situation right now is very uncertain, and many malicious campaigns will surely go rampant.
