---

On the 9th of December 2021, a critical update because a vulnerability was published for the popular open source Log4j&nbsp;2 library. The next day it was classified as **CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;44228**.<!--more--> Some people started calling it “**log4shell**”, as it allowed very easily to do a [remote code execution](/blog/intro-mitre-attack/#tactics) attack. Days later several new vulnerability reports and patches would be published for this and related projects.

The implications are so huge that I had to break this article into two parts. In this first one, I’ll center on my personal investigation of the history of the library, its vulnerabilities, software vendor response, and who are its maintainers (support them!). 

In the second part, I’ll explain in my own words how the vulnerability works, what detections and remediations work, and which ones are only partial or directly are wrong information and won’t work at all.

<i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i> If you are worried about your services in production, stop reading here and update all libraries in your code, the third-party software you use, and ensure your cloud services has not been compromised.

## What is Log4j 2?

[Apache Log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x){:target="_blank"} is a very popular open source Java library used to manage logging messages.

It is included in several frameworks like [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/logging.html){:target="_blank"}, [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/2021/12/10/log4j-cve.html){:target="_blank"}, [Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/guide/6_6/configuring-logging.html){:target="_blank"}, [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.2/configuration.html#configuring-logging){:target="_blank"}, [Apache Struts 2](https://struts.apache.org/announce-2021#a20211212-2){:target="_blank"}, and [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/logging.html){:target="_blank"} (although that doesn’t mean directly that they are vulnerable, read more about this in part II).


The extent of use of this library was so huge that a whole snowball of updates and patches took over the Internet.

## History

A 0-day refers to a vulnerability that was not publicly known before. It may be zero for you and me, but being wildly exploited in secret. To put things in context, let’s start this story at the beginning.


<h3 id="year-2009">2009 (11 years earlier)</h3>

Dissatisfied by Log4j version 1 and other equivalent libraries, **Ralph Goers** starts working on Log4j version 2 for the first time among the Apache foundation. [You can read details about this in his blog post “Why was Log4j&nbsp;2 created?”](https://www.ralphgoers.com/post/why-was-log4j-2-created){:target="_blank"}. It will take years for the developers to consider releasing a stable version.

<h3 id="year-2013">2013 (8 years earlier)</h3>

📅**2013 September 14**: [Log4J 2.0-beta9 is released](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.0-beta9){:target="_blank"}, the first version that years later will be reported as vulnerable.

<h3 id="year-2014">2014 (7 years earlier)</h3>

📅**2014 July 12**: [Log4j 2.0 is published](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.0){:target="_blank"}, first version not alpha or beta, 5 years after the project started.

<h3 id="year-2015">2015 (6 years earlier)</h3>

📅**2015 October 21**: A related [CVE&#8209;2015&#8209;4902](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-4902){:target="_blank"} gets published with the description

> “Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u101, 7u85, and 8u60 allows remote attackers to affect integrity via unknown vectors related to Deployment.”
{:.quote}

Many “unspecified” and “unknowns” for a description. [It could be argued that not specifying the description of the vulnerability shouldn’t be allowed for a complete CVE report](https://twitter.com/adulau/status/1469959657049538561?s=20){:target="_blank"}.


![Chart of word occurrence in CVE, unspecified appears 15000 times](/blog/images/cve_unspecified.png "Chart of word occurrence in CVE, unspecified appears 15000 times")
_Source: [Alexandre Dulaunoy](https://twitter.com/adulau/status/1469959657049538561?s=20){:target="_blank"} [2013 analysis of CVEs](http://www.foo.be/cve/){:target="_blank"} ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search){:target="_blank"})_

The same day, you can read on [ITPro website news](https://www.itpro.com/security/25469/oracle-fixes-vulnerability-used-in-nato-and-white-house-hacks){:target="_blank"} (this is a summary):

> Oracle has patched up a flaw in Java that allowed hackers to breach targets such as **NATO** and the **White House** in an operation known as **Pawn Storm**. The vulnerability was used in attacks on web assets belonging the military organisation as well as a number of prominent companies, according to Trend Micro threat analyst Jack Tang.
\
> The flaw in question (CVE&#8209;2015&#8209;4902) managed to evade Java's Click-to-Play protection, which requires the user to click the space where the Java app would normally be displayed before it is executed. In effect, it asks the user if they are really sure they want to run any Java code.
\
> Bypassing click-to-play protection allows for malicious Java code to run without any alert windows being shown. To mount an attack, a hacker adds the HTML code to a malicious web site and then creates a RMI registry server which has a public IP address as well as creating another web server to hold the malicious Java code, which also has a public IP address.

<h3 id="year-2016">2016 (5 years earlier)</h3>

📅**2016 August 3**: At [BlackHat USA 2016, a presentation](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Munoz-A-Journey-From-JNDI-LDAP-Manipulation-To-RCE.pdf){:target="_blank"} by Alvaro Muñoz and Oleksandr Mirosh from HP Enterprise Fortinet, shows how a combination of JDNI injection and LDAP entry poisoning could be used to make [remote code execution](/blog/intro-mitre-attack/#tactics) possible, as was described in CVE&#8209;2015&#8209;4902 the previous year. These are the same kind of steps involved in exploiting the later discovered Log4j&nbsp;2 vulnerability.

</div>

<h3 id="year-2017">2017 (4 years earlier)</h3>

📅**2017 March 7**: A new vulnerability is discovered, unrelated to Log4j, but on the also very popular open source framework, Apache Struts. A situation where many companies use it and have to patch it develops, similar to what has happened with Log4j&nbsp;2.

📅**2017 March 10**: Reports of hacking groups start looking for systems that are not updated with a fix.

📅**2017 May 12**: [Equifax is hit very hard by a data breach, the biggest known to that date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach#Data_breach){:target="_blank"} because of a vulnerable Apache Struts. Some companies learn they can’t leave security and updating as a second thought. Others… don’t learn it.

<h3 id="year-2021">2021</h3>

📅**2021 October 10**: Jfrog reserves ID [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;42392](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42392){:target="_blank"} that might be for a specific issue or a block or issues. It will not be until [January 6th](https://threatpost.com/log4j-related-flaw-h2-database/177448/){:target="_blank"} it will be used for a vulnerability they have discovered on the H2 database (more on this later).

📅**2021 November 24**: [Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba privately reports the Log4j&nbsp;2 vulnerability](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/how-apache-raced-to-fix-a-potentially-disastrous-software-flaw){:target="_blank"} to the Apache team.

📅**2021 November 30**: A pull request by Ralph Goers (original Log4j&nbsp;2 creator) is opened in the [Log4j GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608){:target="_blank"} titled “Restrict LDAP access via JNDI” to fix the issue.

📅**2021 December 1st**: Log4j&nbsp;2 exploit evidence as early as this day will later be [found and tweeted about by Matthew Prince](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1469800951351427073){:target="_blank"}, CEO of CloudFlare. But it won’t be mass exploited until after the public disclosure.

📅**2021 December 5**: The [pull request is merged](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608){:target="_blank"} five days after Ralph Goers created it. Take into consideration that he states in his bio that “I work on Log4j and other open source projects in my spare time”.

📅**2021 December 6**: [A new version of Log4j&nbsp;2 is released, 2.15.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.15.0){:target="_blank"}, which includes many improvements. This update fixes the [remote code execution](/blog/intro-mitre-attack/#tactics), but 7 days later will be proven vulnerable to a possible denial of service attack. [Among the changes](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/#Mitigation){:target="_blank"}, there is a mention to:

> In version 2.12.2 Log4j&nbsp;2 disables access to JNDI by default. Usage of JNDI in configuration now need to be enabled explicitly. Calls to the JndiLookup will now return a constant string. Also, Log4j&nbsp;2 now limits the protocols by default to only java. The message lookups feature has been completely removed.
{:.quote}

📅**2021 December 8**: Alibaba’s Chen reports to the Log4j&nbsp;2 team again that someone had just [revealed the details of the vulnerability on a Chinese blogging platform](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/how-apache-raced-to-fix-a-potentially-disastrous-software-flaw){:target="_blank"}. 

My opinion is that maybe the author was somebody that saw the pull request. With all the caution Chen demonstrated I doubt it had something to do with him or people near him.
{:.alert.alert-success.vicente-opinion}

📅**2021 December 9**: User [tangxiaofeng7](https://www.cnblogs.com/suyu7){:target="_blank"} publishes publicly in GitHub [a proof of concept for exploiting the vulnerability](https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/CVE-2021-44228-Apache-Log4j-Rce/commit/6c209161477d048d32f3eb3e7b4f83abc9cf94a5){:target="_blank"} (I saw this repository as public, but it has later been deleted or made private; [some content is available on Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20211213101824/https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/CVE-2021-44228-Apache-Log4j-Rce/commits/main){:target="_blank"}). The vulnerability is [being tweeted about](https://twitter.com/P0rZ9/status/1468949890571337731){:target="_blank"} (the tweet has been deleted but [a copy can be seen in Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20211209230040/https://twitter.com/P0rZ9/status/1468949890571337731){:target="_blank"}). At 3:25PM the tweet has 89 retweets, 34 quotes, and 190 likes. 

As related information is only in Chinese, my lack of knowledge of that language, and limitations using Google Translate prevents me to investigate further.
{:.alert.alert-success.vicente-opinion}

📅**2021 December 10**: The vulnerability in Log4j&nbsp;2 for [remote code execution](/blog/intro-mitre-attack/#tactics) is **published** as [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228){:target="_blank"}, with a **score of 10.0** (the maximum value).

The **same day** [reports and news](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/10/severe-flaw-in-java-library-impacts-icloud-amazon-steam-and-more){:target="_blank"} start appearing continuously demonstrating [very popular affected software](https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1469255402290401285?s=20){:target="_blank"}. GrayNoise network security provider tweets about [the number of hosts exploiting the vulnerability increasing from 100 to 150 in several hours](https://twitter.com/GreyNoiseIO/status/1469376214079053833){:target="_blank"}. [Fastly reports](https://www.fastly.com/blog/digging-deeper-into-log4shell-0day-rce-exploit-found-in-log4j#what-we-ve-seen){:target="_blank"} that in 24 hours of the report, the occurrences when scanning for the “jndi:” string that is employed in the exploit has spiked and that attackers are invested in researching different ways of exploiting the vulnerability, which is not true for all 0-day vulnerabilities that become public.

I'm certain this will create a big campaign for hacker groups, not only trying to exploit this vulnerability, but seeking similar 0-days "gems" that may have been also missing in similar circumstances. First on Log4j (but I assume this library is going to get a lot of scrutiny), then for other popular similar libraries.
{:.alert.alert-success.vicente-opinion}

📅**2021 December 13**: [A new version released of Log4j&nbsp;2, v2.16.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0){:target="_blank"} is released, which fixes some special cases that could result in a denial of service attack. It disables JNDI by default (fixing [LOG4J2-3208](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3208){:target="_blank"}) and completely removes support for Message Lookups (fixing [LOG4J2-3211](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3211){:target="_blank"}). [As explained on their website](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/#Mitigation){:target="_blank"}:

> In version 2.16.0 Log4j disables access to JNDI by default. JNDI lookups in configuration now need to be enabled explicitly. Also, Log4j now limits the protocols by default to only java, ldap, and ldaps and limits the ldap protocols to only accessing Java primitive objects. Hosts other than the local host need to be explicitly allowed. The message lookups feature has been completely removed.

📅**2021 December 14**: The related vulnerability [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046){:target="_blank"} is reported that is **fixed in Log4j&nbsp;2, v2.16.0**. It is reported with a score value of just **3.2** (low), 7 days later will be increased to **9.0** (critical).

The same day **Log4j 1.2** is reported on [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;4104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104){:target="_blank"} with score 8.1 (high), as vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. This project is at _end of life_, so no fix will be provided to this or other vulnerabilities that may arise.

📅**2021 December 16**: A new vulnerability is also reported affecting **Logback 1.2.7** and previous versions, a project that forked from the original Log4j 1. Described at [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;42550](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42550){:target="_blank"} with soce 6.6 (medium), using non-standard configuration files an untrusted deserialization of data may occur.

📅**2021 December 18**: New release of **Log4j 2.17.0** is published that "protect from infinite recursion in lookup evaluation", the same day it's classified as [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;45105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105){:target="_blank"}.

📅**2021 December 22**: Chinese Ministry of Information Technology (MIIT) said it will [suspend collaboration for with Alibaba Cloud for not informing the Chinese government first](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-regulator-suspends-cyber-security-deal-with-alibaba-cloud-2021-12-22/){:target="_blank} of the Log4j vulnerability, to be reassessed in six months. [The next day](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3160854/apache-log4j-bug-alibaba-cloud-vows-boost-compliance-after-chinese){:target="_blank} Alibaba Cloud would provide an official statement towards improving its risk management and compliance, arguing that it did not fully comprehend the severity of the flaw at the time.

This sets a precedent for Chinese tech companies to always inform first the Chinese government of any security flaw discovered in open source, or be punished. It gives the government of that country a heads up to fix first their own systems, exploit or collaborate as they like on vulnerabilities like this one.
{:.alert.alert-success.vicente-opinion}

📅**2021 December 28**: Another release for **Log4j 2, version 2.17.1** with related [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;44832](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44832){:target="_blank"} with score **6.6**, for a possible remote code execution (RCE) what only can happen if adversaries can modify the library's configuration. It can be argued that [this is just a misconfiguration](https://snyk.io/blog/when-is-a-cve-not-a-cve/){:target="_blank"} that could be handled by benchmarks, not a vulnerability. The eagerness to find new vulnerabilities in the library is showing.

<h3 id="year-2022">2022 (next year)</h3>

📅**2022 January 6**: [Jfrog publishes information](https://twitter.com/jfrog/status/1479186262770827270){:target="_blank"} on a vulnerability for the H2 database with [CVE&#8209;2021&#8209;42392](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42392){:target="_blank"}, where an attacker may pass a JNDI driver name and URL leading to an LDAP or RMI server, causing _remote code execution_. The corresponding NIST NVD database entry with extended information, score, and vector is not available 2 days later.

## Who has been affected?

!["Everyone" ](/blog/images/everyone.gif "Everyone")

Not only the software you are developing may use one of those frameworks or the Log4j&nbsp;2 library directly, but also many other software products you use may do so.

As the main company behind Java, many [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html){:target="_blank"} products are affected (you need to log into your Oracle account to see the full list).

Users claim that [Steam](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29499867){:target="_blank"} was vulnerable in its chat service, but I find no evidence, and no official announcement has been made. [Netflix](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ANetflix+CVE-2021-44228&type=commits){:target="_blank"} seems to have also patched the library. Apple and iCloud have been affected and [changing an iPhone name](https://twitter.com/chvancooten/status/1469340927923826691){:target="_blank"} has been reported as triggering the vulnerability.

Insecure versions of Log4j&nbsp;2 were available on [Debian](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-44228){:target="_blank"} and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-44228){:target="_blank"}, who have released updates.

[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-44228){:target="_blank"} ships with Elasticsearch that uses a compromised version, but because of the use of the Java Security Manager, access to it is limited so the problem is moderate at most.

Originally for the first CVE, the list of affected software was indicating just Log4j2 from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1. [It has been updated including many more software packages](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228#VulnChangeHistorySection){:target="_blank"}, and **the list of reported affected software will keep growing**. 

I bet it will become be the vulnerability with most software-affected references in the whole database. Also as the library is scrutinized, more previously unknown new vulnerabilities may be reported continuously.

<i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i> As the list of affected software in the vulnerability database keeps growing **a vulnerability scan done today may not tell you all places where you are running software with a vulnerable version of Log4j&nbsp;2**, so you should keep monitoring continuously your security posture to make sure you are not vulnerable.

## Log4j 2 maintainers

![XKCD strip 2346 showing how lots of components depends of a single piece maintained by someone in his spare time](/blog/images/maintainer_nebraska.png "XKCD strip 2346 showing how lots of components depends of a single piece maintained by someone in his spare time")
_Source:  [XKCD comic 2347](https://xkcd.com/2347/){:target="_blank"}_

Log4j 2 was created by [Ralph Goers](https://www.ralphgoers.com/post/why-was-log4j-2-created){:target="_blank"}. The [most active people committing to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/graphs/contributors){:target="_blank"} now are him, [Gary Gregory](https://github.com/garydgregory){:target="_blank"}, [Remko Popma](https://github.com/remkop){:target="_blank"}, and [Matt Sicker](https://github.com/jvz){:target="_blank"}.

Just before the exploit was published, [Ralph had only 7 sponsors](https://twitter.com/MrDanack/status/1469524817946816515){:target="_blank"} on GitHub, on December 15 [he had 78 and going up, but still, none of them are companies](https://github.com/sponsors/rgoers){:target="_blank"}. The rest of the developers with sponsorship enabled had that day a combined amount of 3 sponsors.

In Ralph’s words that you can read on [his GitHub bio](https://github.com/sponsors/rgoers){:target="_blank"}:

> I currently have a full time job as a Software Architect. I work on Log4j and other open source projects in my spare time and so I typically work on those issues that are of most interest to me. **I have always dreamed of working on open source full time and would love your support to enable that to happen**.
{:.quote}

As you can read on the [Apache Log4j website](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/support.html){:target="_blank"}:

>The Apache Software Foundation does not employ individuals to develop and support any of its projects. The individuals who contribute to Apache projects do it either as part of specific tasks assigned to them by their employer, on their own initiative to benefit their employer or on their own free time. While some projects at the ASF have employees who are specifically paid to work on the project, **none of the committers to any of the Logging Services projects are directly paid to work on them**.
{:.quote}

I think they have done an excellent job reviewing, patching, and publishing fast updates to the vulnerabilities. 
{:.alert.alert-success.vicente-opinion}

You can sponsor maintainers of Log4j with a one-time donation, or on a recurring monthly basis on their GitHub profile. **If you can get your company to sponsor them, you will contribute to keep open source safer for you, your company, and everybody else**. The maintainers that accept sponsorship are:

* [Ralph Goers](https://github.com/rgoers#sponsors){:target="_blank"}
* [Gary Gregory](https://github.com/garydgregory#sponsors){:target="_blank"}
* [Matt Sicker](https://github.com/jvz#sponsors){:target="_blank"}

## Thanks for the help

Thank you to all referenced sources for their great job sharing information very early since the beginning of the situation.

Thanks to [@Quemandoacromo](https://twitter.com/Quemandoacromo){:target="_blank"} that after reading the article, sent me a link to Archive.org for the removed repository, and another link for the [Nationaal Cyber Security Centrum](https://github.com/NCSC-NL){:target="_blank"} list of affected software.

## Conclusion

The Log4j 2 vulnerabilities discovered on the 10th of December 2021 have existed since many years ago and have caused a huge snowball of insecurities affecting your project, other open and closed source software, as well as cloud services.

The maintainers of that library work on it in their spare time without official support from any company but have been able to act very fast to publish fixes for the problems.

Despite this, the situation right now is very uncertain, and many malicious campaigns will surely go rampant.

If there is some information I missed in this article, or just want to chat with me, [<i class="fab fa-twitter" style="color:#1DA1F2;" aria-hidden="true"></i> let me know](https://twitter.com/vicen_herrera){:target="_blank"}.

Remember that I'm writing part II describing exactly how the vulnerability works, how to detect and fix it, and what doesn't protect you against it, so check my blog later in a few days for that.

And if you found this information useful, let others know and [<i class="fab fa-twitter" style="color:#1DA1F2;" aria-hidden="true"></i> share it in a tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url={{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}&title={{ page.title | url_encode }}){:target="_blank"}, or [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/R5R77UF84){:target="_blank"} if you want!
