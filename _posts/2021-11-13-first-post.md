It was about time for me to really have a blog. 

<!--more-->

It's not the first one I had. I tried many years ago to have something where several people could write. I also did a small test before a course on blogging with WordPress where I wrote an entry each day, and it was a very interesting experience. That got lost, and didn't have anything of special interest, I have to say. The thing is I like writting, I've been writting several things for work in the past, for leisure when I was very young, and I wish I would have continued to do so. I also like to read, and again, did read a lot before... before the Internet.

I don't think a lot of people is going to be reading this right now, but if you are, you may have some questions. Why now? Is this really going to last? Would I care for Vicente's content? Why in English?

Let's start with the last one. I like writting in Spanish and English. Doing the latter is not easy (not my mother tongue), so doing so will be an interesting exercise. I know many friends will not read my posts if they are in English, but again I don't think they will read this for long anyway. And I also plan to write about experiments I sometimes do and want to keep doing, about cybersecurity, science, IoT, science fiction, and some things I want to have a greater reach. I don't mind few people reading this, but I want to write in a global way. And, I'm writing another thing in Spanish already... but spoilers, I can't tell you about it yet.

Would you care about this? Default answer is that I don't think so. There you have it. But, you are already reading this, so you must have your own reasons. I hope to have something interesting for you to read. If not, tell me so. Anyways I'm not here just to entretain everybody, but I wish I could share information that has some interest for some people.

I plan this to last, lately I've been writing more for work, and longing to continue to do so just for myself. I have the hability, the ideas, the means... I just needed something to kickstart it. And for me, the pandemic has been it. I've been working before it started remote with high intensity, and after a couple of years I need to go out more, see more friends, and write more things. And I don't plan that to be just a phase.

You made to the end of the fist post! Now go read the second one.
