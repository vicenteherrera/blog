This is the personal blog of... me, [Vicente Herrera](https://vicenteherrera.com).

Unless otherwise stated, nothing you find here is endorsed by any current, past or future employer (maybe future ones can time-travel to endorse me, I'm open to that).

Want to contact me? Try [<i class="fab fa-twitter" style="color:#1DA1F2;" aria-hidden="true"></i>@vicen_herrera](https://twitter.com/vicen_herrera){:target="_blank"} (I like public conversations) or any of my [other networks](https://vicenteherrera.com){:target="_blank"}.

This blog is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target=_blank} using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target=_blank} and a modified [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy){:target=_blank} theme, creating a custom generated site with a GitHub Actions workflow.
